Answer following Question:

Consider an undirected graph G = (V, E) with distinct nonnegative edge weights we >= 0. Suppose that you have computed a minimum spanning tree of G, and that you have also computed shortest paths to all nodes from a particular node s Ïµ V. 

Question

Does the minimum spanning tree change when each edge weight is increased or decreased?
Do the shortest paths change?
Write the program of the undirected graph and prove your answer for questions (i) and (ii).
